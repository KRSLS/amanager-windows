Where can i find the android version of the app?
> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.highnd.amanager

Application doesn't start
> Make sure there is a file called sqlite3.dll inside the app's folder

Want the application to start with Windows?
> Go to C:\Users\YOUR USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
> 
> Make a shorcut and place it there

Database location
> AMANGER LOCATION\.dart_tool\sqflite_common_ffi\databases

Want to open the database on your own?
> For the users \\ Table: users \\ Values: username, password
> 
> For the accounts \\ Table: tiles \\ Values: id, username, password, notes

How can i trust your app since it's not open source?
> If you really want to, you can use programs to see if the app is transfering data
> 
> I won't make my hard work open source
